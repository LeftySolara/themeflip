# ThemeFlip

ThemeFlip is a Linux theme switcher written in Python.

## Why?

As someone who enjoys creating themes for my Linux desktops, I spend a lot of time manually
editing config files and managing my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/LeftySolara/dotfiles).
This becomes a bit annoying after a while and makes me reluctant to change things because:

1. It's a pain to edit the config for so many programs.
2. Going back to a previous theme is a pain. Even with version control you end up in situations
   where reverting files includes changes to non-theme settings (keybinds, scripts, etc).

The goal of this project is to create a quick and easy way to switch between themes
without having to worry about affecting other configurations.

## Currently Planned Features

- Saving the current configuration as a new theme
- Loading saved themes by name
- Loading saved themes at random
